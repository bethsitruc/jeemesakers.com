At any rate, there was this one ride when I was a kid called the “Silver Bullet,” a long metal arm with two canisters for riders at each end. You would climb into one of the canisters, buckle yourselves in, and the ride would start and gain speed. Each canister had a chain-driven device that would rotate the canister as well. Just at the point your senses and inner ear fluids got used to the rotation, the operator would suddenly stop the ride and reverse the entire process. It had the effect of crinkling your brain.

Azzam draws a distinction between a fard ayn and a fard kifaya (a duty of the community). A fard ayn is an individual religious obligation that falls upon all Muslims (like praying and fasting). If nonbelievers invade a Muslim land, it is thus a fard ayn—a compulsory duty—for the local Muslims to expel them; if they fail, then the duty falls to neighboring Muslim and so on until, if necessary, it becomes fard ayn upon the whole world.  A child does not need permission from the parents to go, nor even a woman from her husband, to join the jihad against the invader. Thus Azzam argues that the jihad against the Soviets is the duty of each Muslim individually, as well as the entire Muslim people, and that all are in sin until the invader is repelled.)"]})]})}function Zb(t={}){const{wrapper:e}=t.components||{};return e?n.jsx(e,Object.assign({},t,{children:n.jsx(ec,t)})):ec(t)}function tc(t){const e=Object.assign({p:"p",em:"em",blockquote:"blockquote"},t.components);return n.jsxs(n.Fragment,{children:[n.jsxs(Q,{children:[n.jsx("p",{children:`"Let him come; I'll fight to the last drop of blood."`}),n.jsx("div",{className:"epigraph-author",children:n.jsxs("p",{children:["-- Count Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg",n.jsx("br",{}),"Commander of Vienna's Garrison"]})}),n.jsx("p",{children:`"To the Turks it seemed 'as if an all consuming flood of black pitch was flowing down the hills' at whose head fluttered proudly a large flag with a white cross."`}),n.jsx("div",{className:"epigraph-author",children:n.jsxs("p",{children:["-- Ludwig Heinrich Dyck",n.jsx("br",{}),`"Islam at Vienna's Gates"`,n.jsx(u,{number:1})]})})]}),`

Constantinople (Istanbul). He came to the throne at the age of six,

coup. Mehmed IV would become the second-longest-reigning sultan in
Ottoman history after Suleiman the Magnificent. Known as a pious Sunni
Islam ruler, Mehmed IV was primarily known for two things: a revival of
the empire's fortunes and an era of reforms ushered in by the Köprülü
family and expanding the territorial scope of the empire. The Köprülü
family, in turn, produced a series of Grand Viziers, the best known of

The bottom line: soldiers were reduced to a mole-type physical and psychological existence; they lived in a maze of  tunnels and ditches underground; mud, water and drainage were constant problems (especially when it grew colder); they learned to live with rats, vermin and diseases; they were surrounded with death and decaying bodies; all amid the ear-splitting noises of an almost nonstop artillery barrage from both sides."}),`

The Iberian Peninsula was assigned to Saint James. (At the time, the territory we know today as Spain and Portugal was controlled by Rome, having been conquered by Caesar Augustus in 19 B.C.)."}),`

Only Asturias, situated along a thin line of territory along the Bay of Biscay, remained the last redoubt of Christianity.

Yet, at the same time, I knew—and he knew—even as he slipped in-and-out of groggy medication, that it was probably our last time together.

As a corollary observation, outside parties like the U.S., European countries, Russia, China and India, never quite understood the nature of the dance. They still don’t. The nuances of the depth and passion that divides Jew and Arab, and Sunni and Shi’ite, escape regional outsiders.

Israel’s reaction was likewise an untypical dance response: they sought the total destruction of Gaza as a haven for Hamas militants.

Facing this steady attrition of senior military officials, Iran decided to try to change the rules of the game.

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Like most game-changing world events, Iran’s massive attack on Israel last weekend came with its share of head-scratchers. Two of these, in my mind, stand out. First, why did Iran signal its planned strike, code-named True Promise, in advance? Two days prior to the strike, Iran forewarned diplomats of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of an imminent attack that would cross their airspace. This intelligence—confirmed by regional Sunni intelligence organizations in the Gulf region and Turkey—provided a valuable heads-up in terms of the timing and scope of the operation. Israel and its allies used the warning to deploy additional air defenses, shift aircraft, cancel leaves for military personnel, prepare to close the skies over the Middle East, and deny GPS access for outside targeting purposes."}),`

`,n.jsxs(e.p,{children:["Tehran’s advance notice was so bizzare, in fact, that it has birthed a conspiracy theory playing out in U.S. far-right, non-mainstream media circles.

According to this source, Tehran informed Turkey of its intended strike in an effort to limit further escalation. In response, the U.S. allegedly conveyed to Tehran via Ankara, that any action would have to be “within certain limits.” In other words, while President Biden was saying “Don’t” in front of American television screens, behind the scenes he “greenlighted” the strike on our only true ally in the region as long as it took place within certain limits.

`,n.jsxs(e.p,{children:["My second head-scratcher concerns the Iranian supported Shi’ite militia group Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border. Why did Hezbollah—which has waged continuous low-scale, cross-border attacks, and missile firings since the Israeli punitive incursion into Gaza—largely sit this one out? To date, Hezbollah’s leaders have barely dipped into their reported arsenal of between 100,000 and 150,000 missiles in recent cross-border attacks on Israel, firing only an estimated 3,000 missiles. Indeed, since December 2023, following two months of low-intensity border fighting, Israeli forces began to dislodge Hezbollah’s forces from southern Lebanon.

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"There are, in my view, four possible explanations for Hezbollah’s reticence. First, Hezbollah may be going overboard to prove they are autonomous and not under Iran’s thumb. (In the old days, when I was watching Hezbollah and other Shi’ite militant groups, we used to debate the degree to which Hezbollah was an autonomous actor). Iran is 600 miles from Israel whereas Hezbollah is just across the border. Second, Hezbollah may be acting (or non-acting) primarily out of a motive of self-preservation and realizes that Israeli aircraft can reduce to rubble its strongholds in Beirut and southern Lebanon. If another war between Hezbollah and Israel breaks out—the last one was in 2006—the group’s privileged position as an actor in Lebanese politics would be threatened. They don’t want Lebanon to turn into another Gaza. Thirdly, Hezbollah could be husbanding its resources for a future joint push with Iran against Israel. Finally, in line with the forementioned conspiracy theory, Hezbollah was “ordered” to stay on the sidelines to keep the strike within certain, controllable boundaries."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"At any rate, from all initial appearances, it seemed like Israel’s technical superiority won the day (night) last weekend and the Iranians were dealt a decisive, humiliating. blow. The mainstream press in our country—certainly no friends of Israel or Netanyahu—have emphasized the role played by American forces in the region to explain the outcome: over 90% of all inbound weapons systems were destroyed. Much has been made of the switch in theater operational command to CENTCOM, the defensive and secretive air alliance of Sunni regional partners such as Jordan, UAE, and the Saudis (a strategy tracing back to the Trump administration—but no one in Washington D.C. these days will admit that). Indeed, there was unprecedented cooperation in shutting down the airspace over the Middle East to allow IDF and allied aircraft to operate with impunity. But make no mistake about it, the elimination of the unprecedented invasion fleet of ballistic missiles was primarily an Israeli operation. American, British, French, and Jordanian aircraft took out many of the drones (during their nine-hour flight from Iran) and the slower moving cruise missiles."}),`

`,n.jsxs(e.p,{children:["From Israel’s perspective there is only one huge flipside to its operation: the costs incurred. Many years ago, in Washington D.C., I was invited to participate in a wargame exercise set many years in the future in Asia. One of the problems we identified during the exercise was the rate at which the U.S. armed forces burned through its inventory of advanced weapons, which were costly to replace and—given the state of our defense industries—very difficult to replenish. The same logic holds in the wake of this operation. Israel’s Arrow 3 interceptors, for example, are priced a $3.5 million per shot and David’s Slings are $1 million each. Iran’s costs to produce its homemade ballistic missiles used in the attack are probably a tenth of that cost (although they have an estimated 3,000 missiles that can reach Israel and at least 100 launching systems. Furthermore, Iran’s long-range Shahed-136 kamikaze drones, a mainstay of Russia’s drone force in Ukraine, are estimated to cost between $20,000 and $40,000 apiece, a fraction of the cost of any missile-based anti-aircraft weapon. A retired Israeli general estimated that the cost of expended munitions—excluding fuel and operational costs for IDF’s manned aircraft—was over $1.5 billion (another Israeli estimate was $550 billion. Exactly what fraction of Iran’s MRBM arsenal (and what percentage of Israel’s defensive missiles were used) remain important “X” factors when judging which side could outlast the in a future sustained war of attrition.",n.jsx(u,{number:12})]}),`

The city houses an air base and a nearby nuclear site ringed by S-300 antiaircraft batteries (a sophisticated Russian-made air defense system).

But by the way he was acting I felt sure he had. He was so excited. When it was time to open presents there it was a small slim package to me from him. I opened and inside there was a small book about trucks, those of you of a certain age will remember the little golden books they cost about $0.10 and we all had a bunch of them. I had out grown reading them years ago. I looked at it and thanked him....watched him open his present, he got a shirt, from the kid in our class whose father owned a gas station. It was well over the limit but no one cared because he needed it. But he was more excited about how I reacted to my present. You see he knew I loved books, at 8 I was already reading on a high school level and couldn’t get books at the school library because it went to 6th grade and I had read them all. But he got me a book, a Little Golden Book about a subject he loved( trucks) And as I watched him I became more and more pleased with his gift. He kept turning around to see if I liked it, so I read it and thanked him for remembering I loved books.I kept that book for years, brought it with me so he could see I liked it, and though I was well past the Golden book years it became one of my favorites, because it taught me one of the greatest Christmas lessons I ever learned. It is TRULY better to give than to receive. His joy in getting me something he thought I would like overshadowed his getting a really nice present that cost about 10 X what he had given. But he had given a widows mite, all he had, and he gave it with Joy. To this day I love to give, and I think of him every Christmas. His name was Donald, he is about the only person I remember from 3rd grade without a picture. We still lived in Harrisonburg so my WHS friends won’t know him. But I remember him and the Joy of Giving that he taught me. Christmas isn’t about getting but about the greatest gift ever given. Jesus Christ.

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"In an adjacent second theater, just down the corridor, a smaller crowd gathered to watch a steady stream of videos from the ongoing Russo-Ukraine War—Moscow continues calling it a “special operation”—now dancing across the screen. The same movie, with only slight variations, had played for over 650 straight days. Statements of Western leaders are spliced in-between the scenes of war-related carnage (mostly the same timeworn footage of bombed-out apartment complexes, destroyed Russian tanks, downed helicopters, and overhead drone swarms.). Much of this canned footage has been replaced by new video segments featuring modern Western-made tanks, drones and missiles recently added to Kiev’s inventory."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Almost completely missing from the screen images were scenes of Ukrainian units now bogged down in in trenches reminiscent of the stalemated carnage on the Western Front in World War I.

Ukrainian officials, of course, blamed the battlefield stalemate on the slowdown in the flow of promised modern weaponry from the Western allies."}),`

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Still, even today, large overhead speakers (the latest surround-sound system) carry the faint, but discernible, sounds of beating war drums. I wonder if the others seated in the theater can hear them. Now familiar stock footage of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky—the overnight sensation who has been transformed by the elites in the projection room from a local comedian into a global hero before our very eyes—appears in one set of images making virtual presentations to the United Nations, the U.S. Congress, and in the next to the World Economic Forum—at each juncture dressed in his now-familiar camouflaged fatigues. Each appearance on the screen, predictably, is greeted by a ripple of applause from the crowd. By contrast, the visual images of a bloated, sickly-looking Russian President Vladimir Putin are met, predictably, with a smattering of boos."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"The screens on both side panels were dominated by footage featuring a larger-than-life Chinese President Xi Jinping shaking hands with Putin, as ultranationalist Chinese music—musically mixed with the war drums—wafted in the background. Visual images of new Chinese drones, hypersonic missiles, quantum computers, ships, submarines and a sweeping panorama of goose-stepping military units played in the background. Almost instantly, I noticed a targeting map of Taiwanese military sites on the screen. But most of the crowd—preoccupied by the present Ukrainian crisis—had their eyes glued to the main screen in front and paid far less attention to the side screens."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Few in the theater paid attention to a brief news blurb that flashed on the side screen: Xi Jinping is orchestrating a Stalin-like purge of top Chinese officials."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"But I had seen this show before. It was sponsored by the same military-intelligence-industrial-complex that had been running movies regularly in the theater since the Cold War. The only thing that had changed was the techno-complexity (and expense) of the weapons’ systems: the hands in the pockets of the politicians, the use of tried-and-true messaging patterns, and the use of war to divert the audience’s attention from domestic policy failures, were all old refrains. The old Cold War proxy stalwarts—Greece, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan—had merely switched locations: the Ukraine, the Middle East, and the South China Sea."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Indeed, I stood there of two minds: as a Vietnam veteran and based on my many years of service in the intelligence community, I am unabashedly pro-American and pro-military; but, on the other hand, how do I ignore the steady drumbeat for war being orchestrated by the elites? A drumbeat which will, at the end of the day, result in an unending stream of coffins draped in American flags."}),`

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"So, a bit perplexed, I sighed heavily, exited, and entered the next Coming Attraction Theater, “A New Pandemic Variant Looms,” picking up a mask at the door. There was a large crowd. Again, I stood in the back. The same uniformed vendors—some of whom now donned hospital-looking scrubs—distributed popcorn, pretzels, and drinks. I noticed very little had changed about the visual images on the front screen since late 2019: images of shots being administered, the same endless stream of threatened lockouts, social distancing and mask regulations, amid the never-quite-realized promises of dozens of mRNA vaccines, all of which led in the past to shuttered churches (but not “essential” bars and nightclubs) as well as closed or understaffed restaurants, factories and stores. As I scanned the faces in the audience, I thought I noticed definite signs of Covid-19-fatigue etched on most their faces."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"The visual images playing on the screen today displayed a new wrinkle. On the screens I watched hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai crowded with children in overcrowded emergency rooms connected to intravenous fluid lines. The hospital rooms were crammed full. Four years ago, the same hospitals were slammed with the elderly suffering from the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. On the screen, a parade of Chinese media spokesmen and medical experts tried to assure an understandably jittery public: the outbreak was caused by mycoplasma pneumonia (a particular variant is known as “white lung syndrome”) that usually causes upper respiratory tract symptoms but can also prompt more serious lung issues and pneumonia. The ruling Party, again caught off-guard by a spreading disease, blamed the outbreak on colder weather and the lifting of stringent COVID restrictions, and the country’s health officials assured the World Health Organization that no novel pathogens were involved."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"The assertions were met with ripples of laughter from those siting on the right-hand side of the auditorium—even as side screens carried previews of the Wuhan Virological Lab debate, the dangerous side effects of the new vaccines, and the uselessness of masks as protective devices.

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"On the left-hand side, there was a growing sense of paranoia as the audience on that side of the theater searched in their pockets and purses for bigger masks, eagerly signed up for the next round of vaccines, and began mentally preparing for a new round of government-sanctioned lockdowns."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Meanwhile, on the main screen in front, algorithmically produced graphs, buttressed by a steady stream of statistics raced across the bottom of the screen like a Wall Street ticker banner, showed spiking numbers of white lung casualties in Denmark, and locations in the United States (including Warren County, Ohio, where we are remodeling my mom and dad’s house)."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"I felt a dull ache in the pit of my stomach. Like many others, I was hoping that these endless Covid-related sequels were reaching their end—like the last pitiful episode of The Planet of the Apes—and we could move on with normal life.

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"I quickly walked past the next theater playing “Looming Food and Supply Shortages and Future Bank Shutdowns,” where I caught a glimpse of vendors just starting to pass out the fear-laced food and drinks in the slowly filling auditorium. For the first time, I noticed a portal, protected by a thick curtain, connecting the theater with the previous three I had just visited. It was only then that I realized that the issues of the day—and the subsequent messaging—are somehow interconnected. Similar secret passages, I assume, connect the elites running the equipment in the back rooms where the images were projected."}),`

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"As I glanced further down the corridor, I saw several marques blaring out topics like “Climate Change, The End of All Things,” “CRISPR and the Biogenetic Revolution,” “The Great Reset,” and “The End of Fiat Currency.” Smaller but boisterous crowds milled around the doors of each of these, ready to enter."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Then my attention was captured by a small, ordinary-looking theater at the very end of the corridor. Few people shuffling by in the cinema mall entered through the doors. The marque’s coming attraction flashed in bright neon lights: “Jesus Is Coming Soon.” But almost everybody passed by the theater as though it didn’t exist. I noticed that thick spiritual scales covered their eyes which, in turn, were lifeless, listless, and hopeless. Each of them carried a cellphone or pod device—all blasting the noise of this world and echoing the sounds coming from the other theaters—which prevented them from seeing and hearing the message on the marque."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"I heard that no fear-tainted popcorn or drinks are allowed in the theater and all subliminal screen messages were forbidden. Admission to the theater was free of charge. In contrast to the glitzy distractions and worldly narratives featured in the other theaters, the screen portrayed only one simple message: Jesus Christ, the Messiah, is the Way, the Truth and the Life."}),`

Furthermore, as drones become increasingly essential to global war planners, terror groups, and insurrectionists, it has forced our own country to accelerate the development of automated “killer drones”—a technological leap into the unknown we sought to avoid.",n.jsx(u,{number:5})]}),`
`,n.jsxs(e.p,{children:["My first case study is taken from the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War (now heading toward 650 days old). Both sides are using drones in a way, and at a pace, scarcely imaged a decade ago. In addition to the example mentioned above, on one day alone in late November, Russia launched an aerial attack on Kyiv—the Ukrainian capital—involving at least 75 Iranian-made Shahed-class drones. Minimal physical damage was done, according to various sources, because very few of the drones were able to penetrate Ukrainian air defenses (in one report, at least 71 were shot down), but the size of the attack itself marked a major escalation of the conflict. The attack (involving drones and cruise missiles) began at 0400 in the morning last Saturday and lasted for six hours, knocking out power to parts of the city. In addition to Kyiv, at least five other areas were reportedly targeted. Moreover, the attack was apparently designed to coincide with Ukraine’s “Holodomor Memorial Day” in remembrance of millions of Ukrainians who perished in a manmade famine orchestrated by the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin starting in 1932.",n.jsx(u,{number:6})]}),`

(2,204 lb.) payload.",n.jsx(u,{number:10})," Moreover, many experts see China’s prolific civilian drone sector as an important backstop for its military production program: such plans include, among others, using Shenzhen-based DJI, the world’s largest commercial drone maker, which boasts of at least 50 percent of the U.S. drone market.",n.jsx(u,{number:11})]}),`

At the start of the attack, Hamas gained a key advantage by using small commercial drones to drop grenades on Israeli communication towers and video surveillance stations, disrupting the Israel Defense Forces’ ability to relay information as Hamas fighters rushed across the border. According to one commentator, the communications targets were “chosen with such precision because other Hamas drones had been collecting detailed intelligence on Israeli defenses. Hamas also used drones to disable the IDF’s remote-controlled machine guns that were mounted along the border and to drop grenades on tanks and ambulances.”",n.jsx(u,{number:12})]}),`

The military ended a brief flirtation with democracy with a coup in 2021; in fact, the military junta leadership, in one form or another, has ruled the country with an iron fist for over 50 years.

Tsarfati is an Israeli-born Christian commentator who typically specializes in analyzing events in the Middle East. I don’t always agree with him, but his viewpoints are consistently well-reasoned and biblically sound. This is the crux of his argument: Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has been extremely muted in handling Prigozhin and the “coup” participants; the Wagner Group column stopped well short of Moscow when—by all appearances—they had encountered very little opposition and had things going their way; and we still don’t know all of the details of the deal brokered by Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko.",n.jsx(u,{number:4})]}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"As one possible answer to this perplexing puzzle, Tsarfari suggested that what we may be seeing is a case of maskirovka (literally “disguise”), a Russian military form of deception. In his view, Prigozhin never intended for his convoy to reach Moscow and stopped 200 miles short after reaching their real goal, Voronezh-45, a facility close to the central Russian city of Voronezh, where tactical nuclear weapons were stored. These weapons could have been loaded onto rebel trucks."}),`

Plato’s allegory is taken from his work Republic and appears in the form of a dialogue between Plato’s brother (Glaucon) and Plato’s mentor Socrates. The allegory portrays a group of people chained to the interior of a cave all their lives, facing a blank wall. Every waking moment, they watch shadows projected on the wall—puppet-like figures passing in front of a fire behind them. The shadows constitute the chained observers’ respective reality; they even give names to the shadows. Even if one of their number would somehow escape and experience a completely different reality outside the cave wall and would return to tell them, they won’t accept the new truth.","[2] Many of these ideas concerning my walk through the wisdom corridor were generated by a message of Pastor Gary Hamrick at Cornerstone Chapel in Leesburg, Virginia.

`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"First, we need to go back to revering our Founding Fathers. They were an extraordinary group of individuals trying to create a totally new form of government. Almost of all of them put their futures, their property and their very lives on the line. Each sacrificed something. All were guided by a historical precedent: they knew Rome made the transition from a Republic (where individual citizens were respected and treasured) to an Empire (where individuals were viewed as subjects of the governmental machine). From the argument of history, our Founding Fathers became staunch advocates of individual liberty (not license)."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Secondly, they all believed in the providence of God as a guide for the new Republic, and assumed all the citizens would be of a like mind. We were born a Judeo-Christian country and that is the primary source of our blessings as a country. Individual rights are the basic premise of the Christian faith (a relationship rather than a religion): we are held accountable and ultimately judged as individuals and, conversely, enjoy the blessings of God as individuals."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Today, there is very little known or understood about this important aspect of our Founding Fathers. Our great universities and colleges—most of which, by the way, were founded to propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ—view the Founding Fathers through the prism of neo-Marxist thought; therefore, this group of men were part of an oppressive class that promulgated religion (an opiate of the people in Marx’s words) to control the citizenry."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"This line of thought needs to be exposed for what it is."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"In the late 18th century emerged two amazing political revolutions: one was our American Revolution resulting in a Republic where citizens enjoyed inalienable rights granted by God; the second was a protracted French Revolution which ended in the Napoleonic Empire. In the former, the Declaration of Independence and subsequent constitution embraced and codified citizen rights and privileges bestowed by God; in the latter, the centerpiece was the Declaration of the Rights of Man, with its reliance on human reasoning. Today, we see political fault lines breaking along these two lines: on one, individuals endowed by God to pursue life, liberty and prosperity through their own hard work—looking to God as the source—in the other, a reliance on government where the people feel they are entitled to pay without working, education for their children, protections for every ideology, and endless social security networks—looking to man and man’s best efforts as their source. The difference between the two is profound."}),`
`,n.jsx(e.p,{children:"Thirdly, the Founding Fathers lived in a world replete with alternative forms of government they could have used as models. They selected the best ideas of the philosophes and Enlightenment thought in Europe. As former colonists of Great Britain, they cherry-picked the best aspects of parliamentary forms of government and rejected the overbearing aspects of the British monarchy—the world’s greatest empire at the time. They also took a careful look at the Enlightened Despots in many of the great European nation-states; rejected autocratic forms of government then prevailing in China and Japan; and examined a variety of other colonial administrations. It was a grand all-or-nothing experiment. A government of, by, and for the people. Indeed, they set out to create something different that would exalt individuals, reflect God’s glory, and (above all) be lasting."}),`

How the author developed each character and how those characters interacted with each other was so well done as was the going back and forth from 1942 to the “present” time.

I highly recommend this book and feel it would make a great movie.'},{name:"Carl Sode",date:"June 1, 2024",title:"Fantastic Book",review:`Akers hit another home run with Prawnocus Resplendent his second book in the Prawnocus Trilogy. Fast paced action, gritty reality, exotic locations, and a thought provoking end that left me hoping the third book will be available soon. The five overlapping "quest" cycles discussed in the Preface gave me a clear understanding of the dramatic and potentially earth shaking events unfolding throughout the book. The cast of characters section at the beginning of Resplendent served as a valuable reference to help me keep track of the variety of fascinating personalities laced throughout the story. Concise chapters sparked my interest making me thirsty to read on and on. I didn't want to put Resplendent down. Can't wait to see what happens in volume three. If you're curious about the author then check out Akers website, jeemesakers.com, meet the author and sample his "Missives" or articles written about his amazing life stories, insights into history, global events, and many heart warming experiences.

As you can see, it is a pen and chalk rendition—with just a splash of red—of a fierce-looking Chinese dragon.<br/>I began the picture during my last week at the embassy in Singapore. Hidden in the shadows of the high-rise glass and steel behemoths of the city-state’s Central Business District is a small cluster of Taoist temples dating back to the early nineteenth century. I particularly liked to visit one of these because inside—amid the pungent smells of incense and burning papers—were two incredible, intricate stone carvings: a dragon on one side, a tiger on the other.<br/>I was determined not to leave Singapore without obtaining an image of the dragon. <br/>To that end, I entered the temple carrying my camera and an art pad. I asked the monk and keeper of the temple if I could take a picture of the dragon. “T-s-k-k, I don’t know,” he said politely (in Asia many believe that taking a picture of a person or thing somehow robs it of its spiritual essence). <br/>“I understand,” I replied, “would it be permissible for me to sketch the carving?” <br/>Obviously, no one had asked him that. “I guess that would be okay,” he said as he stroked his long white chin-whiskers, no doubt pondering the other-worldly ramifications of his decision.<br/>So, I sat there armed with my trusty art pad and pencils, in front of the huge, imposing, fierce-looking dragon stone carving. And started my drawing. From time to time, one or two temple patrons would drift by, look over my shoulder to study what I was doing and grunt their approval or shake their head. <br/>I was still drawing as the first whispers of dusk enveloped the outer temple compound decorated with its festive red lanterns.<br/>Finally, assisted by the light provided by the temple’s many candles, I applied the finishing touches to my drawing. It had taken me almost all day. As I closed my art pad and prepared to leave, I approached the monk. “You have been so kind,” I said, “I would like to leave a small donation for the temple.” <br/>“You don’t have to do that,” he said with a smile. Then looking over both shoulders to make sure no one was watching (no visitors had been in the temple for at least two hours), he whispered “you can take a picture of the dragon if you won’t tell anyone …”<br/>In Asia, it has been my experience, that a well-intentioned and well-timed gesture of generosity (especially money) can melt down the deepest-rooted traditional, cultural and institutional barriers. My sole regret, as I shuffled away from the temple, was that I hadn’t offered the donation earlier in the day."},{title:"Indonesian Island Treasure",subtitle:"chalk with pen overlay",image:"/artwork/singapore/islandtreasure.png",description:"Adapted from my missive “Three Artworks” During one of the visits of Imogene and Bethany during my time at the Embassy in Singapore, we took a ferry across the Singapore Strait to the Indonesian island of Bintan. Across the bay from our resort, I spotted an interesting structure. After a long afternoon trek that took me across rocks and difficult terrain, I encountered an abandoned small fishing hut located in a jungle-like setting. I took several pictures with my camera (it was during the days before iPhones), made a sketch, added some stylistic modifications and added color.

I colorized the old riverfront buildings and godowns, added an early evening scene, and a Singapore dragon as one side of the bridge crossing the river.
