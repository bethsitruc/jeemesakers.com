<Epigraph>
<p>"Everything is un-American that tends either to government by a plutocracy or government by a mob … The things that will destroy America are prosperity-at-any-price, peace-at-any-price, safety-first instead of duty-first, the love of soft living and the get-rich-theory of life.”</p>

I had intended for my next missive to be another piece on artificial intelligence and the global quest for digital superintelligence. I love thinking about those things. But I have put that writing on the shelf for the time being. There is a more pressing issue at hand. In short, we live in a day and age when our Republic—the greatest form of government ever created by man—is in trouble.

How do I know?

I watch the news on television or my iPhone screen—what I hear and see is no longer a visual representation of events and facts to allow critical thinking citizens to make up their own minds—but now almost everything I see is orchestrated to provide “spin” narrative to influence watchers.

I do not need a crystal ball to see we are in trouble.

Nor do you.

On July 4, 2025, today, we celebrate our national Independence Day. It is more than a day for hot dogs, hamburgers, corn-on-the cob and fireworks. We live in a blessed, unique and one-of-a-kind country. I’m proud of our country, the flag, and the privileges we enjoy; just as important, I willingly served this country in time of war and to protect her from foreign adversaries.

There I said it.

I know there are numbers of others who feel the same way, including many of you reading this missive. Unfortunately, those who feel this way never seem to appear, or if so rarely, on today’s mainstream media.

Our children and grandchildren have to notice the vacuum.

Or do they?

As a former history professor, I marvel at the amazing acumen and sacrifice of our Founding Fathers.

Why have we lost a sense of that?

How have we lost our way?

I am not speaking as a Trump supporter wearing a MAGA hat, or a Christian nationalist, a denizen of the far-right, or a patriotic zealot; I’m speaking as an American citizen. I simply want my children and grandchildren to experience the same freedoms, optimistic future, and economic opportunities that I enjoyed while growing up.

When I was an analyst in Washington D.C., when we produced finished intelligence for the policy makers, we had to boil down our analysis to three points.

I’m going to do the same here.

First, we need to go back to revering our Founding Fathers. They were an extraordinary group of individuals trying to create a totally new form of government. Almost of all of them put their futures, their property and their very lives on the line. Each sacrificed something. All were guided by a historical precedent: they knew Rome made the transition from a Republic (where individual citizens were respected and treasured) to an Empire (where individuals were viewed as subjects of the governmental machine). From the argument of history, our Founding Fathers became staunch advocates of individual liberty (not license).

Secondly, they all believed in the providence of God as a guide for the new Republic, and assumed all the citizens would be of a like mind. We were born a Judeo-Christian country and that is the primary source of our blessings as a country. Individual rights are the basic premise of the Christian faith (a relationship rather than a religion): we are held accountable and ultimately judged as individuals and, conversely, enjoy the blessings of God as individuals.

Today, there is very little known or understood about this important aspect of our Founding Fathers. Our great universities and colleges—most of which, by the way, were founded to propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ—view the Founding Fathers through the prism of neo-Marxist thought; therefore, this group of men were part of an oppressive class that promulgated religion (an opiate of the people in Marx’s words) to control the citizenry.

This line of thought needs to be exposed for what it is.

In the late 18th century emerged two amazing political revolutions: one was our American Revolution resulting in a Republic where citizens enjoyed inalienable rights granted by God; the second was a protracted French Revolution which ended in the Napoleonic Empire. In the former, the Declaration of Independence and subsequent constitution embraced and codified citizen rights and privileges bestowed by God; in the latter, the centerpiece was the Declaration of the Rights of Man, with its reliance on human reasoning. Today, we see political fault lines breaking along these two lines: on one, individuals endowed by God to pursue life, liberty and prosperity through their own hard work—looking to God as the source—in the other, a reliance on government where the people feel they are entitled to pay without working, education for their children, protections for every ideology, and endless social security networks—looking to man and man’s best efforts as their source. The difference between the two is profound.  

Thirdly, the Founding Fathers lived in a world replete with alternative forms of government they could have used as models. They selected the best ideas of the philosophes and Enlightenment thought in Europe. As former colonists of Great Britain, they cherry-picked the best aspects of parliamentary forms of government and rejected the overbearing aspects of the British monarchy—the world’s greatest empire at the time. They also took a careful look at the Enlightened Despots in many of the great European nation-states; rejected autocratic forms of government then prevailing in China and Japan; and examined a variety of other colonial administrations. It was a grand all-or-nothing experiment. A government of, by, and for the people. Indeed, they set out to create something different that would exalt individuals, reflect God’s glory, and (above all) be lasting.

The creativity of this amazing group—and the form of government they created—will be on my mind later today as I gather to celebrate, eat and pray with family and friends.

Let the naysayers protest in the streets. This amazing group of white property owners—our Founding Fathers—created a constitution that gives them that right.

But I will take a moment by myself to thank God for this amazing country in which I have grown up and prospered.

I encourage each of you to do the same.

Blessings,

Jeemes
